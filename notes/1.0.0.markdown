- Initial implementation.
- `isTravisBuild in Global` will be automatically be set to `true` if the current build is running under Travis
    CI.
- `crossScalaVersions in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to the scala versions in `.travis.yml`, falling
    back (with warnings) to the value of `crossScalaVersions in Global` if it can't be found or parsed properly.
- `scalaVersion in ThisBuild` will be automatically set to `TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION` if `isTravisBuild` is true,
    otherwise to the `last` version in `crossScalaVersions`, and so by default, sbt will assume you want to
    develop under the *last* version listed in `.travis.yml`.
